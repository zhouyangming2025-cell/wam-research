                                                    main due to multi-agent scene uncertainty and heterogeneous interaction. Current

                                                    patterns when integrating prediction and planning (IPP). To address this, we ini-

                                         1   Introduction
                                         Autonomous driving system aspires to safe, humanoid, and socially compatible maneuvers [1]. This
                                         drives for formulation, prediction, and negotiation of collective future behaviors among interactive
                                         agents and autonomous vehicles (AVs) [2]. Remarkable accuracy is achieved by learning-based
                                         paradigms [3], including end-to-end modular design [4–7], social modeling [8, 9], and trajectory-
                                         level integration [10–13]. However, substantial challenges arise in real-world cases due to scene
                                         uncertainty and volatile interactive patterns for multi-agent future behaviors.
                                         To embrace compliant patterns for multi-agent future behaviors, current formulations fall into two
                                         mainstreams, dense representation and sparse representation (Fig. 1). Dense representation quan-
                                         tizes agent behaviors under ego-centric rasterization, forecasting bird’s eye view (BEV) occupancy
                                         probabilities [14, 7, 15] or temporal flow [16–18]. It is easy to deduce interactions, perform scalable
                                         behaviors for agents [19], and align with BEV perceptions [20]. Still, dense representation is hindered
                                         by frozen receptions. It causes safety-vulnerable intractability and occlusions potentially interacting
                                         with ego maneuvers [16, 21]. Contrary to pixel-wise behavioral probability, sparse representation
                                         forecasts agent-anchored set of trajectories [22–25] or intention distributions [10, 26, 27]. Its multi-
                                         modal formulation for each agent marks the elasticity in diverse behavioral uncertainty and tractability
                                         under flexile spatial semantics. However, behavioral misalignment [28] and modality collapse [24]

impede compliant multi-agent modeling, requiring exponential computations with growth agent
numbers [29]. Issues particularly result in unstable and slow behavioral learning when exposed
to predictions and planning (IPP) [30]. Typical solutions by conditional prediction [31, 28, 32] or
game-theoretic reasoning [8, 33] often lead to nonstrategic maneuvers [34] due to non-compliant
rollouts in adjusting interactive behaviors. This calls for a re-formulation for multi-agent behaviors,
which should stabilize collective behavioral patterns in a compliant manner for IPP objectives.
The decision-making process for human drivers provides valuable insights. Humans primarily
determine the future behavior of interacted agents for decision-making without relying on their specific
states [2, 36]. Thus, an effective strategy involves assessing agent-wise behavioral impact on planning
maneuvers, and reasoning about compliant interactions. Our fundamental insight is that compliant
multi-agent behaviors exhibit topological formations, which can be identified by distilling consensual
interactions from future behaviors. Prior works have approached this challenge through structural
design [37, 38] or implicit relational learning [39–41] using GNNs [42] or Transformers [43]. Other
studies quantify uncertainty by topological properties [44, 45]. Nevertheless, current literature is
scarce in formulating explicit future supervision of compliant multi-agent behavioral patterns.
To this end, we launch the multi-agent behavior formulation termed as Behavioral Topology (BeTop).
At its core, BeTop explicitly forms the topological supervision of consensual multi-agent future
interactions, and reasons to guide prediction and planning. BeTop stems from braid theory [46],
which infers compliant interactions of multiple paths from the intertwining of their braids. This
empowers BeTop to intuitively distill forward intertwines (occupancy) as joint topology from braided
multi-agent future trajectories (Fig. 1), marrying dense and sparse representation. With the aid of
BeTop, we introduce a synergistic Transformer-based learning stack, BeTopNet, for learning IPP
objectives. To implement, an iterative decoding strategy simultaneously reasons about Behavioral
Topology and generates trajectory sets. Then the topology-guided local attention, embedded in
each decoder layer, selectively queries behavioral semantics from social-compliant agents within the
predicted BeTop priors. To further alleviate multi-agent uncertainty through topological guidance, a
contingency planning paradigm is fitfully deployed. We lay out the imitative contingency learning
process, which regulates the safety-ensured short-term plan. It maintains the long-range uncertainty
by reasoned joint predictions from BeTop. Experimental results exhibit enhanced consistency and
accuracy for prediction and planning in real-world scenarios. Testing in proposed interactive cases
further highlights the planning ability of BeTopNet. To sum up, our contributions are three-fold:
• We bring in the concept of Behavioral Topology, a multi-agent behavioral formulation for topologi-
  cal reasoning that explicitly supervises consensual future interactions jointly for the IPP system.
• A synergistic learning framework BeTopNet, offering joint planning and prediction guided by
  topology reasoning, is devised. Topology-guided local attention and imitative contingency planning
  could resolve scene compliance and multi-agent uncertainty.
• Benchmarking on nuPlan [47] and WOMD [35], our approach demonstrates strong performance
  in both planning strategy and prediction accuracy. BeTopNet witnesses evident improvement

    +4.1% mAP for joint prediction, and +2.3% mAP for marginal prediction.

Multi-agent behavioral modeling. Carving the collective future behavior of diverse agents is
imperative for socially-consistent driving maneuver. Earlier approaches centered around occupancy
prediction [14, 5, 4, 48]. Forecasting the spatial presence under dense BEV representation [49, 20]
offers flexibility of arbitrary agents [17, 50, 19] and alignment with perception [7, 51]. However,
rigidity in resolution induces scenario occlusion [16], rendering intractable occupancy [21]. In
parallel, sparse representation consolidates multi-agent behavior into cohesive modalities across future
trajectories [52, 22, 53, 54] or intentions [27, 10, 26, 55]. Joint future behaviors are derived through
goal-based sampling or recombination from marginal predictions [56–58]. However, the collection
of joint modalities is susceptible to mode collapse and entails exponential complexity [29, 59].
Meanwhile, topological representation has garnered traction as motion primitives [60, 61] or tools [44,
45] for scenario quantification, yet topological properties delineating collective future behaviors
remain largely unexplored. Our BeTop targets the issue, marrying dense behavior probabilities by
topology with the sparse motion from joint predictions to present structured future behaviors.
On the other hand, inconsistent communal agent behaviors have motivated leveraging future interac-
tions. Implicit approaches obtain tacit interactions with attention [62, 32, 63] or GNN [24, 64, 37, 65]
from final motion regressions. Nonetheless, the implicit supervisions are found inefficient in dynamic
scenarios [22]. Contrarily, explicitly reasoning mutual behaviors by conditional factorization [31, 66],
relation reasoning [41, 40], or entropy-based methods [67, 68] offer consistent behavioral priors.
However, hefty variance across agent dynamics and scenario geometries yield unstable inference.
Distinguished from them, BeTop crafts a compact topological supervision that stabilize future inter-
actions among multi-agent behaviors. Derived from topological braids, BeTop offers a topological
equivalent behavioral representation to guide compliant forecasting and planning.
Integrated prediction and planning. IPP system aims to harmonize trajectory-based learning of
future interactive behaviors between the ego vehicle and social agents. Rule-based approaches [69–71]
integrate handcrafted future interactions to evaluate candidate planning profiles, offering remarkable
outcomes in rule-powered reactive simulation [47]. Still, the absence of real-world behaviors
exhibits significant gaps in interactive scenarios. Learning-based methods yield imitative planning
by integrating predictions within holistic modeling [72–74]. However, history-based coalitions pose
challenges in supervising future homology among agents. Recently, hybrid pipelines [8, 75] have
utilized post-processing and optimization upon learning-based models to realize behavior interactions
among predictions and planning. This can entail significant computational overhead, and imitative
planning tends to overestimate hereditary uncertainty in behavior predictions. Tree-based [10, 27]
and contingency-enabled [76, 11] works seek to balance planning preemption and aggression in the
face of behavior uncertainty. Nonetheless, pipelines without holistic interactions fall into passive
planning maneuvers and incur high exponential cost for predictions. In our work, BeTop provides
an explicit prior for future interactive behaviors which enhances compliant trajectory generations.
Moreover, the synergistic prediction and contingency planning networks with BeTop effectively
manage behavioral uncertainty.

3     Behavioral Topology
Presenting BeTop, we commence the Behavioral Topology formulation and task statement of IPP for
autonomous driving in Sec. 3.1. Then, we demonstrate the BeTopNet network architecture (Fig. 3)
for topological reasoning and IPP generation in Sec. 3.2. Finally, in Sec. 3.3, we propose the imitative
contingency learning process by topological guidance for the proposed network.

3.1    Formulation
Problem formulation. We consider the driving scenario with Na agents as A1:Na at presence t = 0,
along with the scenario map M. The states over historical horizon Th are denoted as X1 for AV and
as X2:Na for scenario agents, respectively, where Xn = {x−Th :0 }n , n ∈ [1, Na ]. The objective for
integrated prediction and planning is to jointly predict scene agents’ trajectories Y2:Na as well as AV
planning Y1 over a future horizon Tf as Yn = {y1:Tf }n , n ∈ [1, Na ].

Topological formulation. We leverage the braid theory [46], which probes explicit formulations
for compliant multi-agent interactions from future data Y1:Na . Intuitively, it denotes a transform
process for Y1:Na with respective agent coordinates, and then gathers each future forward intertwine
(occupancy) as joint interactions. Formally, consider the braid group BNa = {σn } by Na primitive
                                               n
braids σn , each of which σn = (f1n , · · · , fN a
                                                   ) denotes a tuple of monotonically increased functions

Y. Specifically, the function fin in σn is defined as fin → (Yi − bn )Rn ; 1 ≤ i, n ≤ Na , where bn
and Rn denote the left-hand transform matrix to local coordinate of agent An . The joint interactive
behaviors are identified as a set of braids having intertwines {σn± } ⊂ BNa over others [45], as
shown in Fig. 2. Opposite to implicit methods [22, 67, 41] banking on future distance heuristic, each
intertwine in the braid can signify an explicit behavioral response, distinguishing between assertive
(σn+ , elicit yielding from others) and passive (σn− , yield to others) maneuvers. To avert difficulties in
dynamic braid set inference, we redraft multi-agent braids from a topology reasoning perspective.
Named by BeTop, the goal is to reason a topological graph G = (V, E) for multi-agent future
behaviors (Fig. 2). Expressly, node topology V = {Yn } is denoted by multi-agent future trajectories.
We can then reformulate the braid set {σn± } as an edge topology eij → E ∈ RNa ×Na ; 1 ≤ i, j ≤ Na
for future interactive behaviors. Each topology element eij can be defined by two braid functions        
fii , fji ∈ σi assessing the future interwines along with Yi , Yj as: eij = maxt I fii (yit ), fji (yjt ) .
Here I is an intertwine indicator by segment intersection [77] under lateral coordinates. With favorable
properties proved in Appendix B, we can formulate the reasoning task as:
                                           G ∗ = (max V̂, max Ê).                                      (1)
Agent future Ŷ in node term V̂ is defined by Gaussian mixtures (GMM) and optimized in Sec. 3.3.
The edge topology reasoning Ê can be specified as a probabilistic inference problem by:
                                    XX
                    max Ê = max            eij log eˆij + (1 − eij ) log(1 − eˆij ),       (2)
                                       i         j

where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ Na . Synergistic reasoning structures are then established optimizing G ∗ .
Comparative analysis. To highlight BeTop’s position among various formulations, we first conduct
a preliminary analysis to assess behavioral similarity by retrieving future interactive agent pairs using
human annotations [35]. Human likeness is quantified by classification metrics, including accuracy
and the area under the curve (AUC), with annotated interactive IDs. As depicted in Table 1, labeled
BeTop achieves the closest behavioral similarity compared with other well-accepted formulations in
the community. Compared with retrieving k nearest strategy (k = 6) by ground-truth future states,
we observe advanced differentiation in non-interactive behaviors (+16.1% Acc., +4.13% AUC) by
BeTop. We then look into the generic learning-based structure by attention [22] or dynamic graph
[67] for interactive behaviors. Despite high accuracy, their inferior AUC scores imply difficulties in
retrieving precise interactivity compared with BeTop (+19.9 AUC). We refer analytical content in
Appendix B. This draft for a reasoning framework BeTop prompting joint behaviors.

Figure 3: The BeTopNet Architecture. BeTop establishes an integrated network for topological
behavior reasoning, comprising three fundamentals. Scene encoder generates scene-aware attributes
for agent SA and map SM . Initialized by SR and QA , synergistic decoder reasons edge topology

with predictions and topology are optimized jointly by imitative contingency learning.

encoded scene semantics X; M, the proposed network features a synergistic decoder which reasons
and guides BeTop. Reason heads for topology Ê and IPP for V̂ comprise the behavioral graph G.
Scene encoder. We leverage a scene-centric coordinate system following planning-oriented princi-
ple [7]. Scene attributes comprise historical agent states X ∈ RNa × Th ×Da and map polyline inputs
M ∈ RNm × Lm ×Dm , where we portion Nm map segments with length Lm from full scene map.
Both attributes are encoded separately as SA ∈ RNa ×D and SM ∈ RNm ×D and concatenated as
scene features S = [SA ; SM ] ∈ R(Na +Nm )×D . A stack of Transformer encoders with local attention
are directly employed in capturing regional interactions from encoded scene semantics SA , SM .
Synergistic decoder. Retaining encoded scene features SA , SM , we zoom in the decoding strategy
that asks for: 1) interactively reason simultaneous BeTop formulations; 2) selectively decoding of
compliant interactive semantics leveraging reasoned topology priors. To this end, we introduce
the iterative process of N Transformer decoder layers contributed to all agents, pursuing the basis
from [78]. To iron out the scene uncertainties, a multi-modal set of M decoding queries Q0A ∈ RM ×D
are initialized for multi-agent future trajectories. Meanwhile, relative attributes SR ∈ RNa ×Na ×DR
are deployed through MLPs as topology features Q0R ∈ RNa ×Na ×D for edge topology reasoning.
Next, we devise dual infostreams to the iterative decoding process for V̂ of future trajectories and Ê
of future topology. Given agent An , the decoding process in layer l follows:
                                                                                     

                                                                                         A ),       (4)

where both future trajectories Ŷn ∈ V̂ and interactive topology ên ∈ Ê in BeTop are decoded in
synergistic manners. Reasoned edge topology êln ∈ RM ×Na are garnered by topological decoder with
query broadcasting Ql−1,n
                       A     ; Reasoning nodes for Ŷn , a Transformer decoder with topology-guided
local attention are drafted serving êln as priors. We provide further details in Appendix C.1.
Topology-guided local attention. Querying whole-scene agent semantics results in misaligned
interactive agents and sparse attention. This motivates our design for local attention guided by the
reasoned topology êln ∈ RM ×Na as priors. Specifically, we retrieve the top-K index ϵln ∈ RM ×K
priored from êln for eventual interactive agents behaviors with An . Interactive indices are directly
leveraged in gathering SA selectively for local cross-attention. This process is formed as:
                                                                                          i∈ϵln

heads accustomed to corresponding formulations for ên and Ŷn . Referred in Eq. (3), the topology
head, planning head, and prediction head (IPP heads) are jointly devised by stacked MLPs in
reasoning BeTop results. For agent An in each layer, reason heads decode GMM components of
future states ŷn ∈ RM ×Tf ×5 (referring to (µx , µy , log σx , log σy , ρ) per step) with mixture score
p̂n ∈ RM ,{ŷn , p̂n } ∈ Ŷn , as well as interactive edge topology êln ∈ RM ×Na for BeTop.

3.3   Imitative Contingency Learning
Pursuing the target in Eq. (1), BeTopNet learns end-to-end objectives imitating human-like multi-agent
behaviors, integrating compliant behaviors by contingency planning under scenario uncertainties.
Imitation learning. Imitation objectives are firstly established in regulating multi-agent behavioral
states {Ŷn } ⊂ V̂ while maximizing their interactive distributions Ê. The imitative objective for
Ŷ is defined by the negative log-likelihood (NLL) from best-reasoned components m∗ closest to
                                    PT               ∗      ∗
ground-truths, as denoted: LV = t f LNLL (ŷnm ,t , p̂m   n , Yn ). Followed Eq. (2), the behavioral
                                                                                                 ∗
distributions for edge topology are computed by binary cross-entropy (BCE) given gathered êm  n ∈
                              N        ∗
RNa , formulated as LE = j a H(êm

                                     n,j , en,j ) over Na agents jointly.

Integrated contingency planning. To integrate compliant behavior learning for G amidst multi-
agent scenario uncertainties, contingency planning [79, 76] is turned out an apt solution. Bridging
immediate safe maneuvers τM to branched planning sets {τJ } with joint prediction, it adjourns
uncertain decisions and ensures actual safety. While direct joint prediction may lose diversity [11],
reasoned topology Ê serves as a suitable medium distilling future interactive agents for efficient
joint combination. Given imitative AV planning outputs τ ⊂ Ŷ1 with branching time tb ∈ (1, Tf ),
integrating contingency learning asks for a safe short-term plan τM ∈ TM , TM ∈ RM ×tb ×2 to full
marginal predictions ŶM = Ŷ2:Na , as well as M branched planning sets TJm = {τJ1:Mb }m guided
by joint predictions ŶJm . This is defined by:
                                                  X                           
                  ∗
                 τM  = argmin max CM τM , ŶM +            P (ŶJm )CJ TJm , ŶJm ,               (6)
                         τ ⊂Ŷ1   Ŷ                      m

where maxŶ CM denotes worst-case cost fir τM ; Joint predictions ŶJ with scene probabilities
P (ŶJ ) are recombined by KM interactive agent subsets, indexing ϵAV ∈ RKM from sorted AV
topology: ϵAV = argmaxKM (maxM ê1 ). It is described by joint costs CJ in guiding branched
planning maneuvers. Specifically, both cost functions are defined by the repulsive potential field [8]
discouraging planning proximity with respective prediction formulations.
Training loss. BeTopNet is trained end-to-end through imitative objectives and contingency planning
costs by weighted integration for each layer, whenever applicable (for the datasets). Please refer
to Appendix C.2 for additional details.

4     Experiment
With preliminary analysis in Sec. 3.1, this section further discovers the following questions: 1) Can
BeTop perform compliant planning via BeTopNet, especially in interactive scenarios? 2) Can BeTop
achieve accurate marginal and joint predictions of heterogeneous agents under diverse real-world
cases? 3) Can the formulated BeTop facilitate existing state-of-the-art prediction and planning
methods? and 4) How do the functionalities in BeTopNet affect the performance?
Benchmark and metrics. BeTop is verified on diverse benchmarks. We leverage two large-scale
real-world datasets, i.e., nuPlan [47] and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [35], which are
presently the most diverse motion datasets in manifesting planning and prediction performance. For
planning tasks in nuPlan, there are in total 1M training cases with 8s horizons. 8,300 separated
testing set are chosen by Test14-Hard and Test14-Random benchmarks [73] for hard-core and general
driving scenes. With further demands verifying maneuvers under interactive cases, we build the
Test14-Inter benchmark filtering 1,340 scenes by testing set. Scenarios ranging 15 seconds are tested
under three tasks: 1) open-loop (OL), 2) close-loop non-reactive (CL-NR) simulations, and 3) reactive

(CL-R) ones by nuPlan simulator. We report the official Planning Scores [80] computed by each task.
The motion prediction tasks in WOMD share 487k training scenarios, with 44k validation and 44k
testing set separately partitioned under two challenges: 1) The Marginal prediction challenge [81]
forecasting multiple scene agents independently; 2) The Joint prediction challenge [82] predicting
joint trajectory collections by two interactive agents. Primary metrics of mAP and Soft mAP are
ranked for official leaderboards [81, 82]. We leave experimental details in Appendix D.

4.1      Main Result
Performance for interactive planning. Table 2 demonstrates the planning results under difficult
and regular test cases. Notably, BeTopNet marks top average planning scores, achieving +7.9%
in hard cases and excels +6.2% (CLS-NR) in closed-loop simulations. Specifically, it gains solid
improvements against learning-based planners. This can be attributed to topological formulations
learning stabilized joint behavioral patterns, boosting +6.2%, +4.3% non-reactive simulations by real-
world logs and enhancing reactive simulation (+11.5%, +6.3%). Contingency objectives enhance
uncertainty compliance, leading to expanded results in hard scenarios. Meanwhile, BeTopNet also
outperforms rule-based and hybrid planning agents asking for post-optimizations [8] or hefty rules
in coinciding with reactive simulation setups [69, 70]. We report +15.8% and +18.4% results of
non-reactive simulation in hard cases and close performance in general scenes. Moreover, interactive
planning compliance is also verified in the proposed Test14-Inter benchmark centering on interactive
scenarios. As in Table 3, BeTopNet fosters +3.8% planning score over previous methods, marking
+5.5% driving progress and +2.9% driving compliance closest to human performance. Qualitative
results of interactive scenarios in Fig. 5(a-d) further corroborate planning compliance by BeTop.

Performance for marginal and joint motion prediction. Marginal prediction results are in Ta-
ble 4. Without the aids of model ensembles or extra data [25, 59], BeTopNet outperforms existing
approaches, manifesting +2.7% and +3.4% mAP metrics comparing concurrent methods [53, 86]
for compliant predictions. Exhibited strong prediction displacement metric (−4.3% minFDE) over
methods using extra pretraining [85], it should be noted that displacement metric is less illustrative as
it discounts uncertainty scoring. BeTopNet further outperforms +6.0% and +26.1% Soft mAP over
multi-agent predictors solely leveraging scenario attention [25] or graph [24]. N. Table 5 exhibits the

joint prediction results. BeTopNet outperforms all methods in both mAP metrics (+4.1%, +3.7%
Soft mAP and mAP), presenting robust prediction compliance credit to BeTop formulations for
stable future interaction patterns and aligned by local attention in BeTopNet. Particularly, BeTop
shows interactive compliance, improving +5.1% mAP over recent auto-regressive approaches [32],
boosting +25.4% mAP with game-theoretic methods [8] by a large margin. Fig. 5 (e-h) demonstrates
the qualitative prediction performance by BeTopNet. At the time of submission, BeTopNet ranked
1st on both WOMD prediction leaderboards [82, 81].

4.2   Ablation Study
Instructed by the last two motivating questions, we investigate the effect of BeTop formulations and
components inside BeTopNet. For efficient study, we randomly partition 20% of WOMD train set for
prediction, and directly report the planning results by Test14-Random benchmark, which are both
representative for the original datasets as verified by [22, 73].
Synergy with existing state-of-the-art methods. We first study the effect adjoining BeTop as
synergistic objectives over existing SOTA methods in planning and prediction. Described in Table 6
and Table 7, BeTop augments +2.1% and 2.0% planning score with learning-based and rule-based
planners, respectively. Similar compliance effects are also witnessed in guiding strong motion
predictors, bringing +1.1%, +2.4% improved mAP with −1.7% prediction errors of minADE.
Number of interactive agents for topology-guided local attention. In determining the number K
future interactive agents for BeTopNet in local attention, we validate the prediction mAP under an
array of agent numbers. Shown in Fig. 4, we observe a converging effect, with maximum +3.7%
mAP by the growing number of interactive agents. A drop of −1.8% mAP is captured after the peak
performance of K = 32. It is due to falsely accepting non-interactive agent values by large K.
Different functionalities in BeTopNet. We further investigate the effects of different functionalities
for BeTopNet in Table 8. Compared to the full model, ablations in ID.1 and ID.2 underscore the
imitative contingency learning process for costs (−2.9% CLS) and contingency branching (−1%
CLS-NR). Sole imitative BeTopNet performs the best OLS (ID.2), while the stabilizing effects found
in Sec. 4.1 are verified (−2.8% CLS-NR) in comparing ID.3-ID.5 for joint interactive patterns.

Figure 5: Qualitative results of planning and prediction in nuPlan and WOMD. BeTopNet
performs compliant reaction simulations in a) yielding for pedestrians; b) cruising in dense traffic.
Interactive scenarios (c,d) further present the consistency of contingency learning. BeTopNet predicts
both compliant marginal (e,f) and joint (g,h) multi-agent predictions under diverse scenarios. Future
interactive behavior patterns can also be consistently reasoned (rendered in light red) with BeTop.



5        Conclusion
In this paper, we present BeTop, a topological new-look for multi-agent behavioral formulation.
Derived by braid theory, the reasoning tasks for BeTop are drafted supervising joint interactive
patterns with integrated prediction and planning. A synergistic network, BeTopNet, is established
with an imitative contingency learning process to boost compliant BeTop reasoning. Experiments on
nuPlan and WOMD verify BeTopNet’s state-of-the-art performance in prediction and planning.
Limitation and Future work. Current BeTop considers one-step future topology alone, and focuses
on prediction and planning. Future work would be centered on developing a recursive version of
BeTop in multi-step, multi-agent reasoning and coordination. Another promising direction would be
the connectivity of BeTop upon perceptions as tracking for the end-to-end paradigm, as well as an
extension on reasoning behaviors under 3D scenarios for multiple autonomous agents.

A    Discussions
Towards a better understanding of this work, we supplement intuitive questions that may raise. Note
that the following list does not indicate the manuscript was submitted to a previous venue or not.
Q1: How does BeTop bridge and discern with dense, sparse, and topological representations?
BeTop is derived from braid theory [46], reasoning the topology that explicitly labels consensual
interactions as dense, occupancy-like intertwines from sparse, braided future trajectories of multi-
agent behaviors. Unlike fixed occupancy [14, 21, 18], BeTop dynamically forecasts behavioral
interactions by agents collectively, serving as a guiding medium for node reasoning in joint planning
and prediction compared to standard sparse predictions [25, 24, 66]. Differentiating from typical
topological approaches, BeTop explicitly formulates coordinated multi-agent behaviors and reasons
topology in occupancy manners, rather than relying on implicit relation graph learning [41, 67, 40] or
complex braid inference [44, 45, 61].

Q2: Why is BeTop allied with contingency instead of conditional or game-theoretic reasoning?
Contingency plays the most suitable role in BeTopNet, addressing multi-agent uncertainty by defer-
ring uncertain planning with long-term joint predictions from interactive agents under behavioral
compliance. This aligns with BeTop’s reasoning targets, which aim to achieve a one-shot consensus
among all behaviors by formulating future behavior as coordinated joint interactions. This synergy al-
leviates the challenges led by game-theoretic reasoning [8, 33] or conditional integration [31, 28, 32],
which are struggled by multi-step interactive rollouts and unstable joint behavioral patterns.

Q3: What would be the broader impact and future direction?
BeTop steps the first trial towards an explicit topological formulation and reasoning paradigm for
multi-agent interactive behaviors. This serves as a basis in exploring immense interactive behaviors in
the real-world, and is reasoned by the autonomous agents jointly in a coordinated manner. For instance,
BeTop with enlarged scalability and dimension may summarize the topology for all behaviors in 3D
scenarios or even larger spaciality, and may reasoned through end-to-end BeTopNet as a foundation
behavioral model. Moreover, we can consider BeTop’s capability as collective maneuvers, which
can be further leveraged in coordinating naturalistic and efficient decision-making for multiple
autonomous agents.

B    Properties of BeTop
In this section, we supplement additional properties that characterize the formulation of Behavioral
Topology (BeTop). Analytically, BeTop is highlighted with: 1) geometric invariant (Theorem B.1); 2)
approximated topological invariant (Theorem B.2); and 3) asymmetric topology (Theorem B.3).
Theorem B.1 (Geometric Invariant). The topology results of E ⊂ G in BeTop remain unchanged
given arbitrary geometrical transformations for the collective scene trajectories Yn .

Proof. Given arbitrary rotation H ∈ R2×2 and shifting b ∈ R2 . Consider the mapping g for elemen-
tary topology eij ∈ E from future trajectories (Yi , Yj ), i ̸= j ∈ [1, Na ], the local transformation
f : g → h ◦ f to i’s coordinate is invariant, such that h(f (Yi , Yj )) = h(f (HYi + b, HYj + b)).
Hence, given the function sets fji ∈ σi ⊂ f, I ∈ h defined in Sec. 3.1; eij ∈ E is also invariant.
Remark 1. The Theorem B.1 proves the behavioral stability of BeTop given arbitrary multi-agent
trajectories patterns for planning and predictions. Any rotations and movement of the original scene
will not interfere with the formulated results of BeTop.
Definition B.1 (Topological Invariant). Given future trajectory pairs (Yi , Yj ), i ̸= j ∈ [1, NA ]
with certain current heading (θi0 , θj0 ), the sum of future relative angles (winding number) wij =

   PTf      t
2π    0 ∆θij form its first-order [87] topological invariant.


Proof. Consider the polar representation for the closed form ψi (t) = ||ψi (t)||eiθi (t)
                                                                                      R . Where ψi :
                                                                                  1
[0, Tm ] → C\{0}, i ∈ [0, n], we can define the winding function λi (t) = 2πi           ψi
                                                                                           dz/z, z =

ψi (t), t ∈ [0, Tm ]. This Cauchy formula [2] can be further integrated as:
                                      1       ||ψi (t)||     1
                          λi (t) =       log(            )+    (θi (t) − θi (0)).                      (7)
                                     2πi      ||ψi (0)||    2π
We are interested in the real (first-order) part of λi (t) which is an invariant topologically. Hence,
the trajectory pairs (Yi , Yj ), 0 < t ≤ Tf < Tm can be described as: Yi = ψi : (0, Tf ]. The joint
                                PT
invariant across future wij = t f (λi (t) − λj (t)) then becomes:
                                          Tf                   Tf
                                    1 X t              1 X 0
                             wij =      (θi − θjt ) −     (θ − θj0 ).                                  (8)

                                                                                       PTf
As the current heading pair (θi0 , θj0 ) is certain, the invariant becomes wij = 2π       0
                                                                                                t
                                                                                              ∆θij which
proofs the definition.

Corollary B.1.1. Given any ∆θij   t
                                    ∈ [− π2 , π2 ], where 0 < i.j < Na , t ∈ (0, Tf ], and the constant
                              T      T                t
                                                        − ηi sin θit ) is also topological invariant.
                                    P
ηi , ηj ∈ R, the transformed wij = 0 f (ηj sin ∆θij

Proof. The defined function sin(·) is a monotone mapping under [− π2 , π2 ]. Hence, this firstly enables
PTf         t                                        T
  0 ηi sin θi uniquely defines Yi . More than that, wij is the unique mapping value of wij with Yi
under defined transformation, and thereby keep the invariant property.

Theorem B.2. The edge topology E ⊂ G is an approximate of topological invariant, so that
eij ∈ E, 0 < i, j ≤ Na is characterized by wij .

Proof. Given future trajectories Yi , Yj , we consider the braid functions σi maps monotonically
increased transformations fii , fji to i’s local coordinate,as defined in Sec. 3.1. We assume a continuous
future horizon (0, Tf ] where the headings for fji (Yj ) is defined by relative angles ∆θij (t). Thereby,
                                                                     Rt
the transformed lateral trajectory for agent j can be formed as: 0 ηj sin ∆θij (t)dt. Similarly, fii (Yi )
                   Rt
can be formed as 0 ηj sin θi (t)dt, where ηi , ηj denotes small constant step lengths.These form the
original intersection function I in Sec. 3.1 as:
                                                    Z t
                         I fii (yit ), fji (yjt ) →               t
                                                                     − ηi sin θit )dt,
                                                 
                                                        (ηj sin ∆θij                                    (9)
                                                   0

where I(·) = 0 denotes braid intertwine for interactive behaviors. As the term in Corollary B.1.1 of
  T
wij (the sum of the right term) is an approximate (discretization) of the right term, this proves the
edge topology eij ∈ E → maxTf I (·) as the approximation of topological invariant.

Remark 2. The Theorem B.2 proves the generality of BeTop in terms of future interactive behavioral
patterns. The approximated topological invariant property prompts a representative of various future
states sharing similar behavioral or identical interactive patterns by BeTop.
Theorem B.3 (Asymmetric Topology). Edge topology E ⊂ G is not symmetric such that ∃i, j, eij ̸≡
eji , 0 < i, j ≤ Na .

Proof. Given Eq. (9) defined in Theorem B.2,we can always construct a case ∃ti , tj ∈ (0, Tf ], the
                                                         t           t
intersection I fii (yiti ), fji (yjti ) = 0, but I(fij (yjj ), fij (yi j )) ̸= 0, which prove the claim.
                                       

Remark 3. The Theorem B.3 proves a more naturalistic interactive behavior of BeTop. It is likely in a
real-world scenario that the future behavior of agent Ai is interacted by agent Aj , while Aj does not.

Computational complexity. The complexity in computing full E is O(Na2 ). In practice, we
downscale the sourced as the agents of interests NI < Na , such that O(NI Na ). It is much less
than braid sequence inference [45] with maximum O((Na − 1)Na ) computational costs. Further
analytical proof of computational efficiency leveraging braids can be found in [44].

C         Implementation Details
In this section, we instantiate further details for BeTop on the configurations for BeTopNet structure,
and provide contingency learning paradigms for both prediction and planning challenges.

C.1       Model Structure
Subjecting to different testing requirements defined in nuPlan and WOMD, we set up two model
variants for BeTopNet in formulating planning and prediction challenges. Apart from topology
reasoning for interactive behaviors, for planning challenges, BeTopNet integrates both tasks of
prediction and planning. In the prediction challenges under marginal and joint settings, BeTopNet is
allocated only with the prediction parts. The structural details are illustrated below.
Scene inputs. Carving the driving scenarios involves historical agent states X and map polylines
M as scene inputs. For planning settings, we collect scene agent states with past Th = 2 seconds
at 10Hz, leaving basic kinematic states as (x, y, vx , vy , θ), joining with agent shapes and types. We
only keep the current state for ego vehicle (AV) in preventing closed-loop gap [73, 69, 88] with
open-loop training as recently discussed in the community. Nm = 256 segments of the map with
length Lm = 20 are gathered by scene-centric manners considering positions, traffic lights, and speed
limits. The prediction task is built on WOMD considering Th = 1 seconds at 10Hz with scenarios of
larger scalability. It is followed by full scene agents with Nm = 768 map segments of identical states
for both X and M.
Scene encoder. Both scene attributes X, M are firstly encoded leveraging layered point encoder [89]
to hidden dimension D shared throughout the BeTopNet structures, with D = 128 for planning and
D = 256 for prediction tasks. A stack of Transformer encoders is then devised with 4 layers in
planning and 6 in prediction for SA , SM . Due to scalable settings for prediction tasks, local attention
with the nearest 16 keys is built in each layer. Following [22, 73], the dense prediction head is adopted
for all agents after the encoder, enhancing future semantics.
Synergistic decoder. Depicted in Fig. 6, the decoder structure is founded by an iterative stack of
L Transformer decoders querying M modes of future trajectories Ŷ with dual stream in reasoning
topology Ê. Consisting of L = 6 and L = 4 decoders for prediction and planning respectively, it is
initialized jointly by relative features Q0,n                         0,n
                                          R and decoding queries QA . Relative attributes SR are
computed efficiently following [64] for relative distance and headings. M = 6 learnable embedding
are devised as Q0,n
                  A for planning, and we utilize the anchored ones [22] with M = 64 in prediction
                                                  j−1,n

                                                                       18
decoding process (following Eq. (3)) iteratively reasons êln from TopoDecoder, serving as a prior
guiding agent semantics by TopoAttn inside TransDecoder, which concurrently aggregates scene
semantics from agents SA and maps SM . Expressly, the structure of TopoDecoder (Fig. 6(b))
comprises simple MLPs and update Ql,n   R by concatenation sourcing query features QA
                                                                                          j−1,n
                                                                                                 with
agent semantics SA , and connect residuals Ql−1,n

                                                                                      A    is updated
by a concatenation from aggregated agent feature Cl,n                   l,n
                                                    A , map features CM , and agent semantics SA
                                                                                                    n

directly from encoder. Agent feature CA is aggregated by TopoAttn, where the local attention is
devised using deployments from [90] indexing K = 32 agents from reasoned topology êln . We omit
the aggregation process for map features, which performs the vanilla Transformer decoder structure
for planning and dynamic collection form by [22] under prediction tasks for hefty map features.
Reason heads. Following the contents in Sec. 3.2, reason heads in decoding prediction and topology
follow simple MLPs given respective decoding queries. For the planning head, it leverages a
cascaded design for branched contingency planning with multi-modalities (Fig. 6(c)). Specifically,
the short-planning τM is decoded by the AV future states {ŷ11:tb }m from first stage head with m ∈ M
modes, where tb = 3 denotes the branching time. They are then detached and leveraged as prior
for the branched planning. Successive MLPs project and reshape the short-term contingency prior
by RM ×MJ ×D for MJ = 6 branches planning TJm under each of τM           m
                                                                            . Further concatenated by
broadcasted decoding queries, the planning head generates M · MJ trajectories Ŷ1 for AV.

C.2   Imitative Contingency Learning
Efficient joint prediction recombination. Retrieving the top-performed joint predictions from full
marginal predictions ŶM sequentially is time-consuming with exponentially complexity. Hence, we
firstly downscale the potentially interested agents NI by sorting the AV-reasoned topology êL   1 with
the largest KM = 4 value as index given the planning task. For the joint prediction task, NI = 2 is
annotated already from the original data. Then, we leverage the tensor broadcasting mechanism in
efficiently retrieving M = 6 largest joint distributions P (ŶJM ) and joint trajectories ŶJM from NI
                                             N
interacted agents. Given a tensor PJ ∈ RM I initialized by ones, the joint score is computed by NI
                                                                                       QN (n)
times of iterative broadcasting p̂n on the n-th dimension for PJ as PJ = maxM n I PJ ⊗ p̂n .
This process only costs 1.6ms in computing NI = 4 joint predictions for contingency planning.
Imitative contingency objectives. Followed by learning objectives derived in Sec. 3.3, the imitation
objectives for each layer can be represented as LIL = LV + λ1 LE . λ1 = 50 weighting BCE loss for
edge topology reasoning, the NLL loss for LV is formulated as:
                                                                           
                              log(1−ρ2 )                 2   2
                                                      dx     dy         dx dy
  LNLL = log σx + log σy +        2
                                              1
                                         + 2(1−ρ2 )   σx   + σy − 2ρ σx σy − log p(m∗ ), (10)

where dx , dy denotes the difference with ground-truths. In determining the component m∗ , we
leverage a winner-take-all (WTA) strategy [91] in planning by measuring the average displacements
(ADE) with groung-truths. For prediction tasks, m∗ is selected from the closest anchor as in [53]. For
the learnable cost functions max CM (·), CJ (·) in contingency planning, we leverage the repulsive
potential field [8] delineating planning with prediction by ϕ = mind 1/(1+d(τ, ŷ)). For max CM (·),
ϕ is gathered across Tf considering the worst case under full marginal prediction ŶM comprising
Na = 32 scene agents. For the branched cost CJ (·), ϕ for each branch is computed considering
joint prediction from NI = 4 agents. Following the objective defined in Eq. (6), the learnable
                                                  PM
contingency cost is defined as: LCL = CM + m P (ŶJm )CJm . Hence, the general objectives for
planning become:
                                       L = LV + λ1 LE + λ2 LCL ,                                  (11)
where λ2 = 5 is the contingency costs weight. Prediction tasks are updated only by LIL .
Inference. Different from the training process, for the planning task we directly select the full
planning trajectory of Tf = 8 seconds by highest scoring τ ∗ = argmaxC Ŷ1 , subjecting to the
original task settings in nuPlan. The scoring results are a combination from original confidence p̂1
and the short-term cost CM [69]: C = p̂1 + λm CM , where λm = 0.5 facilitates short-term planning
compliance [92]. For the prediction task, a post-processing module following [53] is leveraged in
selecting M = 6 marginal or joint trajectories of Tf = 8 seconds among 3 agent types in WOMD.

D     Experimental Setup Details
In this section, we provide extra details demonstrated in Sec. 4 for the experiment setups, including
detailed settings for the proposed benchmark, testing metrics, state-of-the-art baselines, and training.

D.1   Planning on nuPlan
Testing metrics. For open-loop planning tests, the open-loop score (OLS) serves as the general
statistics weighting displacement metrics and miss rates. For closed-loop simulations, both metrics
(CLS, CLS-NR) are weighted by a series of statistics measuring 1) driving safety, 2) planning
progress, 3) driving comforts, and 4) rule obeying. The PDMScore [93, 94] compared in Table 3 is
basically a replica of the closed-loop score for efficient computations. It is denoted as:
                                                       w1 TTC + w2 DC + w3 EP
                        PDMScore = CA · DAC · DDC ·            P              ,                    (12)
                                                                  wi
where the sub-metrics are abbreviations referred in Table 3. All general metrics range from 0 to 1.

Test14-Inter. We launch the Test14-Inter benchmark in verifying the planning systems under typical
corner cases containing rich social interactions, or dynamic profiles by complex map forms. This is
highly motivated by the issues raised in [69, 88], that massive scenarios may also be completed by
a simple motion model. Specifically, we adopt a mining heuristic defining corner cases by which
human experts excel but the motion model (constant acceleration vehicle, CAV) fails. For efficient
mining, we directly assess planning results by PDMScore and define the criteria as:
                        (PDMScore CAV < γ) ∧ (PDMScore Expert ≥ (1 − γ)),                          (13)
where γ = 0.1 denotes a scoring threshold for cases that cannot be easily solved by regular motion
profiles of the planning maneuvers. As future work, we aim to explore more interactive scenarios
aggravating by BeTop as an enhancement.

Val14. In pursuing comprehensive comparisons with current methods, we also manifest BeTopNet
in the Val14 set proposed in [69]. It is a subset of 1040 scenes from the validation set. However,
since a portion of validation scenes are shared with the training set in nuPlan [80], we argue this
is less representative of testing fairness for learning-based methods. Hence, we only place it as
supplementary.

Baselines. For all baselines presented in the planning task, we directly report their previous benchmark
results. Additional results in the proposed benchmark (Table 3) and ablation studies (Table 6) are
re-implemented by the official releases [69, 72, 47, 69]. Expressly, we study the state-of-the-art
planning systems categorized by: 1) Rule-based: performing maneuvers by designate rules with the
reactive agents [70] or mimicking the planning score [69]; 2) Hybrid: incorporating rules [69] or
post-optimizations [8] with a learning-based model; and 3) Learning-based: end-to-end planning
with GNN [83, 74] or Transformer [72, 73] enabled models, as well as concurrent methods [92]
augmented by representation learning. For ablation studies in Table 6, BeTop is trained directly
by the proposed topology decoder with the original PlanT [73] pipeline. For the PDM [69] as a
rule-based planning system, we integrate BeTop by replacing the original rule-based motion model
with predictions generated from BeTopNet.

D.2   Prediction on WOMD
Testing metrics. For the prediction task, the mean AP (mAP) and Soft-mAP scores are assigned as the
primary metrics in computing multi-modal predictions modeled by marginal or joint distributions [35,
81, 82]. Displacement metrics of minADE and minFDE provide the multi-modal prediction errors
closest to ground truths without considering the prediction scores.

Baselines. We also directly provide the prediction results displayed on the official leaderboards
in Tables 4 and 5. Ablation studies in Table 7 are reproduced by the official codes [22, 53]. The
prediction performance of BeTopNet is compared against SOTA baselines by: 1) GNN-enabled
interactive graph [37, 24]; 2) conditional or game-theoretic behavioral interactions [31, 8]; 3) DETR-
based Transformer attentions [22, 25, 53, 86]; and 4) auto-regressive modeling [32].

current learning-based methods [92] leveraging extra contrasting learning for training augmentations.
BeTopNet is also featured by leading driving safety (+2.7% CA, +1.0% TTC) and compliance
(+2.8% DDC) compared with other strong models [73, 8]. However, due to the data leakage of Val14
with training set by a part of shared scenarios, we only provide the results as a reference.
Additional planning effects in Test14. To delve into the planning results of BeTopNet, we present
statistics measuring by another detailed metric, PDMScore, for both of the Test14 benchmarks in
Table 2. Exhibited in Tables 10 and 11, BeTopNet delivers strong maneuver safety and compliance,
marking solid PDMScore from both benchmarks. Compared with learning-based methods, BeTopNet

excels in closed-loop driving progress (+15.1%, +7.5% EP), safety (+5.6% TTC, +2.9% CA), and
the general score (+8.5% PDMScore). For rule-based systems, the leading performance is empirically
by virtue of a constant driving progress. This may refer to an unresolved copy-cat problem [73] for
imitative planners. It requires further integration and fallback with rule-based methods for on-board
AD system design in practice.

E.2    Prediction
Per-category marginal prediction. In Table 12, We mainfest the prediction performance of BeTop-
Net under each prediction category. Compared against the concurrent SOTA motion predictors [53],
BeTopNet demonstrates superior mAP-based metrics among all types for compliant predictions.
Specifically, overall improvements in Cyclist denote refined interactive patterns captured by BeTop,
as the cyclist predictions are the most uncertain task with less reliance on map information.

Per-category joint prediction. We further instantiate the per-category joint prediction of BeTopNet
with SOTA methods in Table 13. Compared with concurrent methods [32] featuring auto-regressive
decoding, BeTopNet achieves robust displacement metrics, while outperforming in prediction com-
pliance of mAP metrics (+8.7%, +20.9% mAP) due to advanced joint modality scoring stabilized
by edge topology in BeTopNet. Moreover, the coordinated joint behaviors reasoned by BeTopNet
largely mitigate the unstable patterns against game-theoretic method [8] (−15.6%, −15.7%, −9.7%
Miss Rate) under similar model architecture.

F     Additional Ablation Studies
Scaling effects of model and decoding agents. The scalability challenges begin with the scaling of
our BeTopNet models to accommodate varying scene agents and map. Experimentally, we configure
BeTopNet with different model scales to evaluate whether our approach maintains its effectiveness.
In Table 14, BeTopNet is evaluated by three model scales varying in decoding modalities and
dimensions. The results demonstrate that BeTopNet consistently improves prediction accuracy, with
an increase from 0.391 to 0.442 (+13.4% mAP) and a decrease in the Miss Rate (−11.9%). This
showcases its enhanced robustness in handling multi-agent settings by enlarging model scales.
In Table 15, BeTopNet reports comparable computational costs compared to [22], while with better
prediction accuracy shown in Table 12. The similar latency is due to the topo-guided attention,

which reduces the KV features in agent aggregation during decoding. While BeTop introduces extra
computations for reasoning, it requires more GPU memory for cached topology tensors.
Temporal granularity in BeTop. Table 16 explores the effect of varied temporal granularity in
BeTop, with minimal adjustments to BeTopNet. In our study, future interactions are split into multi-
step BeTop labels. Topology reasoning task is then deployed through expanded MLP Topo Head
for output steps. Compared to the baseline 1-step reasoning, multi-step BeTop reasoning slightly
improves performance (e.g., 2-steps, +0.2 mAP), with a corresponding increase in computational costs
for additional steps. This highlights the potential of multi-step reasoning to enhance BeTopNet in
interactive scenarios, while refining temporal granularity for more accurate and efficient interactions
remains an open question. We believe how to effectively leverage multi-step BeTopNet represents an
interesting area for future exploration.
Synergy with additional model foundation. To understand the generalization under different model
foundations, we conduct additional ablations integrating BeTop with reproduced Wayformer [62]
in [95]. As reported in Table 17, incorporating BeTop as supervision improves vanilla Wayformer
with a −6.2% Miss Rate and +3.2% mAP. Furthermore, integrating BeTopNet significantly boosts
performance, achieving a +18.6% mAP and −7.2% Miss Rate. This enhancement is due to syn-
ergistic decoder design, which uses iterative BeTop reasoning and Topo-guided attention to refine
trajectories by selectively aggregating interactive features.
