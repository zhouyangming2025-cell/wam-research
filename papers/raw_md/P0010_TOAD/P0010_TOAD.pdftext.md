                                                       However, the scorer is applied only after the proposals are generated and cannot

                                        1       Introduction

                                        End-to-end (E2E) planning has become the leading approach for autonomous driving [1, 2, 3]. A
                                        single network maps sensor data and ego state directly to a driving trajectory. Several state-of-the-art
                                        methods share a common recipe. They first generate a finite set of candidate trajectories, either drawn
                                        from a large pre-computed vocabulary [4, 5, 6, 7] or produced on the fly [8, 9, 10]. A scorer then
                                        picks the best trajectory from this set.
                                        The scorer is at the core of the planning pipeline. It is trained to imitate an oracle of driving quality
                                        (safety, progress, comfort), and can therefore be seen as a learned, trajectory-level reward function,
                                        an objective that can be optimized. Yet current planners use it only once: generation is one-shot, and
                                        the scorer only ranks the fixed set of proposals. If every candidate is poor, the planner has no recourse
                                        and still returns the best of a bad set. We see this as a missed opportunity and ask whether the scorer
                                        can be used for more: not just rank a fixed set once, but guide a search for trajectories that score well.
                                        We introduce TOAD, a test-time procedure that turns the frozen scorer into the objective of a search
                                        over trajectories, at no training cost. Concretely, TOAD wraps a frozen E2E planner in an inference-
                                        time loop based on the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) [11]. At each iteration, we sample trajectories
                                        from a Gaussian distribution, score them with the frozen scorer, refit the Gaussian to the top-k
                                        candidates (‘elites’), and repeat. The search is warm-started with the planner’s selected trajectory
                                        and confined to its neighborhood, which limits how far the search can drift from the scorer’s training
                                        distribution.
                                        A key finding is that not all trained scorers can serve as rewards. Test-time search succeeds only when
                                        the scorer stays accurate beyond its training proposals, since it explores trajectories outside any fixed
                                        set. Scorers fit to a fixed vocabulary [4, 5, 6, 7] fail: they are accurate on their own candidates but
                                        degrade sharply elsewhere, and our loop with them drops below the baseline, despite looking strong
                                        under standard ranking evaluation. Only a disentangled scorer trained to evaluate freely decoded

                                                Equal contribution
trajectories [8] works in TOAD. Test-time search thus exposes a hidden weakness in standard scorers
that ranking evaluation cannot reveal.
As it only requires only a frozen planner and a generalizing scorer, TOAD is plug-and-play. We attach
a single frozen scorer to six base planners, iPad [10], Hydra-MDP [4], GTRS [5], ZTRS [6], RAP [9],
and DrivoR [8], and improve PDMS for all six on NAVSIM-v1 [12] and EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2
[13]. Gains are largest for lower-performing planners and smallest for stronger ones (+43.6% on iPad,
+3.1% on DrivoR), as TOAD closes the gap between the base planner and the scorer’s best-scoring
trajectory. The gains come from the search itself, not from a stronger scorer: simply re-ranking the
base planner’s proposals with the scorer can even hurt performance, whereas TOAD improves it.
On NAVSIM-v2, DrivoR + TOAD reaches 56.3 EPDMS, a new state of the art that nearly matches
the privileged PDM-Closed (56.6) [14]. TOAD also improves DrivoR’s zero-shot HD-Score on the
photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM simulator [15]. Code will be released.
Our contributions are as follows:
 • We reframe the E2E trajectory scorer as a learned reward function that can be optimized, not only
   used to rank a one-shot set of proposals.
 • We propose TOAD, a test-time search that plugs into any base planner with no retraining.
 • We show that a successful optimization requires a scorer that generalizes beyond its training
   proposals, exposing a weakness in fixed-vocabulary scorers.
 • Across six planners, TOAD gives consistent gains on NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2, a new state
   of the art on NAVSIM-v2, and improved closed-loop performance on HUGSIM, at negligible cost.

End-to-End Driving and ‘Score-and-Select’ Approaches.
E2E learning is now dominant in autonomous driving. Early systems used complex pipelines of
hand-designed modules for detection, tracking, and mapping [16, 17]. Recent methods instead map
sensors and ego state to a trajectory with a single network [2, 18, 19], often dropping 3D supervision
and bird’s-eye-view representations [20, 8]. Progress is measured on open-loop or pseudo closed-loop
benchmarks such as NAVSIM-v1/v2 [12, 13] and simulators such as HUGSIM [15].
The strongest E2E planners share a recipe: they generate candidate trajectories, score each, and
output the highest scored [4]. Candidates come from a large vocabulary of pre-computed trajectories
[4, 5, 6] or are generated on the fly, e.g., by diffusion or learnable queries [20, 21, 10, 9, 8]. Either
way, the scorer is trained to imitate a driving-quality oracle and selects the trajectory by argmax.
A clear trend is to enlarge the candidate set with ever denser vocabularies [22, 7] which increases
runtime latency [8] and often overfits the scorer to the fixed vocabulary. Further, oracle studies show
an ideal selection can beat the human driver [22], suggesting the candidate set, not the scorer, often
limits performance. Some scorers are trained to transfer across vocabularies [5]. However, they
still rank a fixed set, which differs from staying accurate on freely searched trajectories. We instead
ask whether a trained scorer can act as a reward function and search for trajectories beyond that set,
further boosting the performance.
Test-Time Optimization and Search for Planning.
Sampling-based optimization and MPC have a long history in robotics and driving. Gradient-free
samplers like the Cross-Entropy Method [11, 23, 24] and Model Predictive Path Integral control [25]
sample trajectories, score a cost, and refit toward low-cost regions, typically inside Model Predictive
Control (MPC). Classical MPC for driving uses hand-designed costs; later work learns parts of
it, e.g., cost maps from images [26] or cost weights in a differentiable planner [27]. Closer to us,
UniAD [2] post-optimizes its trajectory against a predicted occupancy map at inference. We share
this search-at-test-time idea but optimize a full learned end-to-end scorer, without predicting any
intermediate representation such as future occupancy maps.

Figure 1: Overview of TOAD. A frozen base planner outputs trajectory proposals and a selected
anchor τbase (left). Trajectories are mapped to controls by the inverse bicycle model (BM−1 ). Then, a
Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) loop runs for K steps in control space: sample controls, rolls them out
with the bicycle model (BM), scores them under ‘Scorer + reg’ (the learned reward with comfort and
anchor regularizers), refits the Gaussian to the highest-scoring elites. The scorer and BM are frozen.


Test-time training adapts the model itself rather than the trajectory. Centaur [28] updates an E2E
planner at test time by minimizing an uncertainty measure over its predictions. We are complementary
and lighter: model weights stay frozen, we only search the trajectory space.
Inference-time search on a fixed model has driven large gains in language models, via inference-time
reasoning [29, 30] and search guided by verifiers or reward models [31]. This is appearing in driving
too: re-ranking candidates with a vision-language model [32] or scoring them online with a learned
world model [33, 34]. We also search at inference, but over a continuous trajectory space rather than
a fixed set, using a single learned scorer rather than an auxiliary model.
Learned scorers as rewards connect our setting to model-based RL, where a learned reward guides
action selection. Several driving methods use a reward during training: RL fine-tuning of planners
[35], reinforced diffusion for generation [36], and RLHF for driving styles [37]. We instead use a
frozen, already-trained scorer purely at inference, as the search objective, with no policy learning and
no change to the generator.

3     Method

We present TOAD, illustrated in Fig. 1, a scorer-based method that enhances trajectories produced by
an arbitrary planner at test time. We introduce the scorer in Sec. 3.1 and then detail the optimization
algorithm and its design choices in Sec. 3.2.

3.1   Scorer as a Reward Function

Our method uses a scorer S as a reward function over trajectories. A trajectory τ = (p1 , . . . , pnp ) is a
sequence of np future poses pt = (xt , yt , θt ) ∈ R3 in the ego frame. Conditioned on the observation
o (sensor inputs and ego state) and the goal g (target or route), the scorer maps a complete trajectory
to a scalar, S(τ ; o, g) ∈ R. S is a neural network trained jointly with a base planner. We treat S as a
reward function over the trajectory space, which we treat as the action space. This enables searching
for reward-maximal trajectories rather than ranking a fixed candidate set.

3.2   Test-Time Trajectory Search

We instantiate this search with the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) [11], a classical sampling-based
optimizer. To keep the search where the scorer is reliable, we confine it to a trust region around the
base planner’s proposals (Fig. 1, left). The following paragraphs describe and motivate each design
choice; we ablate them individually in Sec. 5.


                                                        3
Optimizing in control space. For the sampling-based search, the choice of search space is not
obvious. Sampling directly in pose space would yield jagged, dynamically infeasible trajectories,
since it ignores vehicle dynamics entirely. We instead inject this prior through a kinematic bicycle
model (BM) and search over a sequence of controls,
                                              n
                                           p
                                 u = (ut )t=1 ,    ut = (at , ωt ) ∈ R2 ,                             (1)
where at and ωt are the per-step longitudinal acceleration and yaw rate. Our BM is invertible, so
controls and trajectories are equivalent representations. From a control sequence u we roll out
a trajectory at the current ego speed v0 as τ = BM(u, v0 ), and recover the controls by inverse
kinematics, u = BM−1 (τ, v0 ), both illustrated in Fig. 1. This approach is standard in sampling-based
control [25, 23] and trajectory optimization [38, 39], and buys two properties for free: every sample
is smooth and feasible, and the comfort, defined on accelerations (the controls) and jerks (their
derivatives), can be computed directly from u.
Planner-based trust region. In principle, CEM can run from any initialization (see Fig. 4a for
ablations). We instead deliberately constrain the search to a small trust region around the base
trajectory proposal conditioned on the observation o and the navigation goal g, because the learned
scorer of Sec. 3.1 is more reliable nearby. Outside this region, the search can drift toward trajectories
that the scorer rates highly but cannot truly judge, which could lead to reward hacking.
Formally, we assume access to a trained base planner that maps an observation o and a goal g to a set
of N candidate trajectories together with a selected trajectory,
                    BASE P LANNER(o, g) = (T , τbase ),     τbase ∈ T = {τ (i) }N
                                                                                i=1 .                 (2)
This formulation covers existing planners, including single-candidate ones where T = {τbase }. Given
the ego speed v0 , these map equivalently to control sequences, U = {u(i) = BM−1 (τ (i) , v0 )}N i=1 ,
with a selected one ubase . We use these to define the trust region, with ubase its anchor, while the
spread of U sets its extent.
TOAD: CEM with trust region prior. In TOAD, the trust-region prior shapes both the CEM cost and
its initialization. CEM maximizes J(u), an objective combining S and two closed-form regularizers:
                                              
                     J(u) = S BM(u, v0 ); o, g − λa Canchor (u) − λc Ccomf (u).               (3)
The first regularizer, Canchor (u) = ∥u − ubase ∥2 , ties the search to the trust region by penalizing
deviation from the anchor. The second, Ccomf , accumulates squared violations of the standard
kinematic comfort limits (longitudinal and lateral acceleration, jerk, yaw rate, and yaw acceleration);
being exact and closed-form, it supplies a signal the learned scorer estimates only coarsely. We
evaluate Ccomf over the future controls and the last executed control, penalizing uncomfortable
transitions from the vehicle’s recent motion.
To start the search, the CEM mean is set to the anchor, µ0 = ubase ; the standard deviation starts
from the spread of the base planner’s own proposals, σ0 = max(β · std(U ), ϵ) with β < 1 and
a small floor ϵ that prevents exploration from collapsing entirely. Exploration thus depends on
the planner’s own uncertainty. We run CEM over controls with a Gaussian N (µk , diag(σk2 )) in
R2np . At iteration k = 1, . . . , K, we draw M control sequences, roll them out, evaluate J, and
keep the E highest-scoring sequences as the elite set Ek . We then refit the Gaussian to the elites:
µk = mean(Ek ), σk = std(Ek ).
After the final iteration, we roll out per CEM standards the trajectory induced by the converged mean,
τmean = BM(µK , v0 ). We return whichever of it and the base proposal τbase maximizes the cost,
                        τ ⋆ = arg max S(τ ; o, g) − λc Ccomf BM−1 (τ, v0 ) .
                                                                                
                                                                                                   (4)
                            τ ∈{τmean , τbase }

Canchor is excluded here: the CEM mean should not be penalized for deviating from the anchor.
Comparing against τbase guarantees the returned trajectory never has a lower cost than τbase .
Scorer choice. CEM requires a scorer that stays accurate off the base planner’s proposal distribution,
which is why TOAD uses DrivoR’s disentangled scorer [8]. We highlight one property of our setup:
the same scorer serves every base planner and need not be the planner’s own.

4         Experimental Results

We evaluate our test-time search on standard driving benchmarks. TOAD consistently improves
various base planners on NAVSIM-v1/2, setting a new state of the art on NAVSIM-v2. It also
improves over DrivoR on the closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark (Sec. 4.2). We then demonstrate
TOAD requires a scorer that is standalone from the trajectory head (Sec. 4.3). Finally, we isolate the
source of the gain, and ablate the design choices (Sec. 5). Our code will be open-sourced.

4.1       Experimental Setup

Benchmarks and metrics. We evaluate on NAVSIM-v1 [12] (navtest split) and NAVSIM-v2 [13]
(navhard-two-stage split), two pseudo-closed-loop benchmarks built on real driving logs. We
also evaluate on HUGSIM [15], a closed-loop evaluation benchmark with photorealistic scenes
constructed using 3D Gaussian Splatting [40]. For the ablation, we use warmup-two-stage* as
validation set for NAVSIM-v2 containing 7 scenes. Metrics are detailed in App. A.
Base planners. We show that TOAD is plug-and-play, by evaluating it on six base planners spanning
both proposal styles, i.e., fixed-vocabulary scorers (Hydra-MDP [4], GTRS [5], ZTRS [6]) and
on-the-fly generators (iPad [10], RAP [9], DrivoR [8]). For each, we use the public checkpoint and
its released trajectory proposals; no models are updated.
Hyperparameters. Unless stated otherwise, we run K = 5 CEM iterations for planners with
on-the-fly generators and K = 100 for those with fixed-vocabulary scorers due to its much larger
vocabulary (>8K) that initializes the search. The per-iteration candidate count M is fixed to 64
considering search inference cost, and the elite count to E = M/8. We use an initial-std scale
of β = 0.5, floored at ϵa = 0.1 m/s2 and ϵω = 0.025 rad/s. The objective uses comfort weight
λc = 0.05 and anchor weight λa = 0.5. All values above are kept fixed across base planners and
benchmarks; ablations are conducted in Sec. 5.

4.2       Main results

NAVSIM-v2 [13] and NAVSIM-v1 [12]. Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 reports NAVSIM-v1 navtest and
NAVSIM-v2 navhard-two-stage results. TOAD improves every base planner on both benchmarks.
On NAVSIM-v2 the gains range from +2.3% (ZTRS) to +43.6% (iPad), and they compress the
ranking: the six planners start almost 20 EPDMS points apart (34.7 to 54.6) but all land between 49.0

and 56.3 after search. The weakest planners gain the most, while DrivoR, already the strongest, gains
+3.1% to reach 56.3 EPDMS, outperforming the strongest learned method (DriveFuture [41], see
in Tab. 6, 55.5) and is only 0.3 behind the privileged PDM-Closed (56.6), which uses ground-truth
perception. Complete benchmark tables are provided in Tab. 5 and Tab. 6.
The search uses whichever sub-score has room to improve. On the harder, out-of-distribution
NAVSIM-v2 scenes it trades a little progress for large safety gains in no-collision, drivable-area,
and time-to-collision see Tab. 6. On the near-saturated NAVSIM-v1, where safety is already high, it
instead extends progress. Again the weakest planners gain most (ZTRS +2.4%, iPad +1.9%) and the
strongest least, with DrivoR reaching 94.7 PDMS, the top entry and -0.1 below the human driver.
HUGSIM [15]. Tab. 4 reports zero-shot closed-loop evaluation, applying TOAD on top of DrivoR.
The safety sub-metrics (no-collision, drivable-area, time-to-collision) and, above all, comfort improve
on nearly all four datasets, the comfort gain a direct effect of the control-space search. These gains
raise the HUGSIM Driving Score (HDS) where there is room, most clearly on nuScenes (DrivoR:
39.7 to 49.9) and KITTI360. Route completion tends to drop, showing that the searched policy drives
more cautiously, and on Waymo this caution leaves the score slightly lower. The improvements
transfer to a closed-loop simulator with no tuning suggests they reflect genuinely safer driving.
Qualitative Results. We show in Fig. 2a the refined trajectory manages to avoid collision from the
car in front. Using TOAD we produce a better trajectory, inexistent in the original set of trajectories.
Aligned with the observations in Fig. 4c, the reward is not always precise and can occasionally fail.
Such failures may occur when visual cues are unreliable due to limited visibility, illustrated in Fig. 2b.

4.3    The gains require search and a generalizing scorer

Two factors explain TOAD’s gains: they come from search discovering new trajectories rather than
re-ranking or smoothing existing ones, and they only appear with a scorer that remains accurate off


                                                                           6
the proposal distribution. We verify both in Tab. 3, with two base planners iPad [10] and Hydra-MDP
[4] on navhard-two-stage. Detailed performance breakdown can be found in Tab. 7.
Search versus re-ranking and smoothing. We compare TOAD against two simpler modifications of
the base planner. Smoothing (BM) maps the selected trajectory through the bicycle model to remove
jitter without changing its route; it has little effect (iPad +0.8%, Hydra-MDP −5.1%), showing the
gains are from better trajectories, as seen in Fig. 2. Re-scoring re-ranks the original proposals with a
scorer, without new trajectories. When using DrivoR’s scorer as in TOAD, re-ranking is inconsistent:
it improves iPad (+31.5%) but hurts Hydra-MDP (−8.8%). In contrast, TOAD consistently improves
performance (+43.6% and +21.6%). The gains therefore come from search discovering better
trajectories outside the proposal set, not from reordering or smoothing existing ones.
The scorer must generalize. We also run the search with different scorers as rewards. Only
the DrivoR scorer [8] improves performance; GTRS [5] and SparseDriveV2 [7] reduce it below
baseline (e.g., iPad drops to 23.9 with GTRS). We attribute this to their training setup. GTRS and
SparseDriveV2 are trained to score a fixed vocabulary of precomputed trajectories, so they receive no
supervision away from that set and need not behave sensibly there. DrivoR, by contrast, is trained
jointly with a trajectory generator while remaining disentangled from it, forcing it to score freely
decoded trajectories rather than a fixed grid. We hypothesize this is why it remains reliable on the
off-proposal trajectories explored by our search, making it the only scorer suitable as a reward.

The search cannot avoid running the scorer’s
perception backbone in the first place. In DrivoR Figure 3: Per-sample inference cost across meth-
the scorer is part of the base planner, sharing a ods. The bar length is the total inference time per
single backbone: scoring reuses the features the sample, decomposed into the base planner (light
planner already extracted, and the search is close gray), the scorer backbone (dark gray), and our
to free (1.9 ms on top of DrivoR’s forward pass). test-time optimization (TOAD, blue).
When the scorer is external, it needs its own
perception, redundant with the planner’s, so features are extracted twice. This is the roughly 100 ms
scorer backbone carried by other planners in Fig. 3. The lesson is to build well-generalizing scorers
directly into the planner, then strong test-time search comes essentially for free.

5     Ablation Study
TOAD component ablation. We ablate the different components in TOAD with iPad [10]. • Warm-
start. We compare the warm start initialization against a normal initialization, with a mean set to
zero and the standard deviation to one. • Bicycle model. As an alternative of smoothed control space,
TOAD can also operate directly in the trajectory space. In this setting (traj. space), we directly sample
trajectories consisting of 8 future (x, y) locations in bird’s-eye view coordinates. • Reward terms. We
study the importance of different reward terms: scorer reward, comfort reward and anchor reward,
by comparing them against both the vanilla baseline without TOAD and the full configuration.

                 Figure 4: Ablation study of TOAD with iPad on warmup-two-stage.



In Fig. 4a, first observation is that with TOAD, the overall performance is improved compared to
vanilla planner. We observe that the initialization from a standard normal distribution still achieves
competitive performance (42.7 vs. 48.5), suggesting that TOAD can generalize to a broader class of
E2E planners that output only a single trajectory without associated scores.
Another important observation is that the scorer reward provides the primary optimization signal,
leading to a substantial performance gain (48.5 vs. 35.7). In contrast, the comfort and anchor rewards
provide complementary improvements (48.5 vs. 46.9, 44.4). Finally, optimization in the control space
consistently outperforms optimization in trajectory space. We hypothesize that this is because the
control space (e.g., acceleration and yaw rate) is naturally bounded, whereas trajectory coordinates
are unbounded and therefore more difficult to optimize effectively.
Number of candidates M , iterations K, and elites E. Overall, TOAD consistently outperforms
the vanilla baseline across different hyperparameter settings, demonstrating its robustness and low
sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. As shown in Fig. 4b, performance generally improves as
the number of sampled candidates increases. Interestingly, sampling only two control sequences
already yields an improvement over the vanilla baseline without TOAD. To maintain a low inference
overhead, we cap the number of candidates at 64, resulting in less than 1.9 ms runtime per execution.
In Fig. 4c, we observe that the warm-start initialization enables rapid convergence, with iPad reaching
peak performance after 5 iterations. The performance degradation observed with additional iterations
highlights the imperfect correlation between the learned scorer and the true EPDMS objective.
For instance, the scorer does not explicitly model extended comfort metrics that require temporal
consistency across adjacent frames. Finally, Fig. 4d shows that selecting 8 elites empirically provides
the best performance under a candidate budget of 64, corresponding to approximately one-eighth of
the sampled candidates. This result offers a practical guideline for choosing CEM hyperparameters.



6      Conclusion

Trajectory scorers in end-to-end planning are learned reward functions, yet only used to rank a fixed
candidate set. We show that this set, not the scorer, is the real bottleneck. TOAD, a simple CEM loop
that searches against the frozen scorer, improves six base planners across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2,
and HUGSIM, at negligible cost and with no retraining. CEM can only succeed if the scorer stays
accurate off the proposal distribution, which most current scorers do not. This points to a clear
direction: planners whose scorer is built to generalize, so that strong test-time search comes for free.
Limitations. TOAD warm-starts from a base planner’s proposals, whereas a sufficiently accurate
scorer and optimizer should in principle allow searching from scratch. This raises the question of
whether scaling the scorer with more data and capacity could eventually remove the need for a base
planner altogether. A second limitation is the reliance on DrivoR’s supervised disentangled scorer. A
promising direction for future work is to reduce the reliance on costly trajectory-level annotations
needed to train such a scorer, for instance through self-supervised or world model-based rewards.

A     Driving Metrics
In the study, we use the official metrics as defined by their original benchmarks.

NAVSIM-v1 [12]. We use the Predictive Driver Model Score (PDMS) which aggregates submetrics:
No-at-fault Collisions (NC), Drivable Area Compliance (DAC), Time to Collision (TTC), Ego
progress (EP), Ego Comfort (Comf.). Details of subscore descriptions and aggregation strategy can
be found in the original benchmark paper.

NAVSIM-v2 [13]. We use the Extended Predictive Driver Model Score (EPDMS), computed over
the two stages of the evaluation. Compared to PDMS, the EPDMS includes additional Driving
direction Compliance (DDC), Traffic-line compliance (TLC) and Lane Keeping (LK), and replaces
the ego comfort metric by the History Comfort (HC) and the Extended Comfort (EC).

HUGSIM [15]. We use the official HUGSIM Driving Score (HD-SCore or HDS), which mimic
the NAVSIM-v1/2 metrics. It uses five sub-scores: no collisions (NC), drivable area compliance
(DAC), time-to-collision (TTC), comfort (COM) and Route Completion (RC) which replaces the ego
progress by the percentage of route covered by the agent in the current scenario.

B     Evolution of Trajectories during CEM
In Fig. 5, we illustrate the increase in reward and the corresponding improvement in the EPDMS score
throughout optimization. We also observe that the mean elite trajectory distribution is progressively
refined, shifting toward the right lane and exhibiting better forward progress. This behavior differs
from both the vanilla and human trajectories.

B.1   Detailed Results in NAVSIM Benchmarks

NAVSIM-v1 detailed results. In Tab. 5 we report PDMS and its constituent sub-metrics on
navtest. Tab. 5 shows that the safety columns (NC, DAC, TTC) are already saturated for every base
planner. Thus, TOAD improves PDMS on the different base planner by boosting the ego progress
sub-metric (EP), while maintaining on-par performance on the safety sub-metrics. Leading to an
increase in PDMS for all 6 base planners.

NAVSIM-v2 detailed results. In Tab. 6 we report EPDMS and its Stage-1 and Stage-2 sub-metrics
on navhard-two-stage. Tab. 6 shows that, unlike on navtest, the safety columns (NC, DAC,
TTC) still leave headroom on these harder out-of-distribution scenes. Thus, TOAD improves EPDMS
on the different base planners by raising the safety sub-metrics while trading off a small amount of
ego progress (EP), with the shift concentrated in the more demanding Stage 2. Leading to an increase
in EPDMS for all 6 base planners.

What drives the gain: detailed results. In Tab. 7 we report the per-sub-metric breakdown of
smoothing, re-scoring, and search with different scorers, on top of iPad and Hydra-MDP. Tab. 7
shows that smoothing leaves nearly every sub-metric unchanged, re-scoring moves individual sub-
metrics inconsistently across the two planners, and search with fixed-vocabulary scorers (GTRS,
SparseDriveV2) degrades several sub-metrics at once. Only TOAD with the DrivoR scorer raises
the safety sub-metrics jointly without collapsing progress. Confirming that the gain arises from
the synergy in TOAD between search and an off-proposal-accurate scorer, rather than from scoring
alone.

Table 7: What drives the gain? (i) trajectory-smoothing, (ii) re-scoring the original proposals
with DrivoR scorer [8], GTRS scorer [5] and SparseDriveV2 [7], and (iii) using different scorers as
rewards — on top of iPad [10] and Hydra-MDP [4]. Evaluation on NAVSIM-v2 with EPDMS [13];
larger is better.
