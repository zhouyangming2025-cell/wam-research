# Biological Images

Use this for microscopy, photographs, electron microscopy, clinical images, image panels, overlays, insets, scale bars, channels, stains, annotations, and quantified image displays.

## Use this when...

- The figure uses images as evidence rather than only decoration.
- The user asks about scale bars, insets, annotation hierarchy, channel identity, overlays, representative images, or image-analysis reporting.
- The biological claim depends on what can be seen in the image.

## The job of this topic

Make image evidence interpretable by exposing scale, identity, channel meaning, annotation logic, selection context, and analysis workflow.

## Default workflow

1. Identify image type and specimen: organism, tissue, cell type, structure, stain/channel, and acquisition context if supplied.
2. Inspect the actual image before judging contrast, artifact, exact annotation placement, scale-bar adequacy, or visual quality.
3. Check scale: use scale bars or dimensions with units where interpretation requires them.
4. Check insets: mark source regions, state the magnification relationship, and keep crop boundaries clear.
5. Check channel/color mapping: explain each channel color and biological target; ensure merged views remain interpretable.
6. Check annotations: arrows, outlines, labels, and symbols should identify features without covering evidence.
7. If images are quantified, separate representative-image display from analysis workflow and replicate reporting.

## Decision rules

- Scale information is required when size, morphology, distance, or localization matters.
- Magnification alone is weaker than a scale bar or explicit dimension at final display size.
- Insets need both source-region markers and their own scale context.
- Channels need both color identity and biological target identity.
- Dense annotations should move outside the image, use callouts, or provide annotated and unannotated versions.
- Quantified image claims need acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation or selection criteria, measurement definition, replicate structure, statistics, and software/data availability where relevant.

## Variants and edge cases

- Multi-channel fluorescence: use single-channel panels plus a merged panel when readers must judge channel-specific signal.
- Representative images: state the sampling or replicate context when the image supports a general claim.
- Photographs: include orientation, specimen identity, and scale/object reference where they affect interpretation.
- Adjusted images: disclose relevant processing and keep treatment comparable across panels.

## Anti-patterns

- Missing scale bars or units.
- Insets without parent-location boxes.
- Channel colors unexplained in the legend.
- Arrows or labels covering the feature they identify.
- Representative images used as the only support for a quantitative claim.

## Diagnostic questions

- Can a reader tell what organism, tissue, cell, or object is shown?
- Are all compared panels interpretable at compatible scales?
- Does the legend explain channels, stains, annotations, insets, and sample context?
- Would the image still work in grayscale or for common color-vision deficiencies?
- Does quantification rely on image-processing choices that need disclosure?

## Output patterns / mini-templates

```text
Image-panel issue: <scale/inset/channel/annotation/workflow>.
Fix: <specific change>.
Legend addition: <required explanatory text>.
Visual inspection needed: <contrast/artifact/exact placement claim, if not inspected>.
Risk if unfixed: <interpretive failure>.
```

## Examples

- `Inset with no box`: add a rectangle on the parent panel and label the inset scale.
- `Merged fluorescence only`: add single-channel panels if the reader must judge channel-specific signal.
- `Representative image plus quantification`: report how images were selected, segmented, measured, and summarized.

## When not to apply this

Do not give acquisition-protocol advice unless asked; keep the answer on figure interpretation, presentation, and reporting.
