# Review Modes

Use this to choose quick scan, focused review, deep integrated review, reviewer-style critique, mentor-style feedback, collaborator-style feedback, readiness check, or line edit.

## Use this when...

- The user did not specify how deep the review should be.
- The artifact is long and cannot be fully line-edited in one pass.
- The relationship or destination changes how feedback should be framed.

## The job of this topic

Match the review depth and voice to the user's goal so feedback is useful rather than either too shallow or too exhaustive.

## Default workflow

1. Infer the likely mode from the prompt and artifact.
2. If mode changes the work substantially, ask one clarifying question.
3. State the mode and what it will not cover.
4. Apply only the detail level appropriate to the mode.
5. Offer a next-pass option when deeper review would be useful.

## Decision rules

- Quick scan: return top priorities, strengths, and next action; do not line edit.
- Focused review: review the named dimension only, such as figures, claims, audience, or feasibility.
- Deep integrated review: combine multiple lenses and return a revision sequence.
- Reviewer-style critique: write major concerns, minor concerns, overclaim risks, and decision-relevant evidence.
- Mentor-style feedback: preserve agency, explain rationale, and include questions or next discussion points.
- Collaborator-style feedback: emphasize shared goals, concrete edits, and tradeoffs.
- Readiness check: return ready/needs revision/blocked with must-fix items.
- Line edit: revise wording only after structure, claim, and evidence are already in scope or stable.

## Variants and edge cases

- When the user asks "be harsh," keep the feedback direct but still actionable and bounded.
- When the user asks for "quick" feedback on a high-stakes artifact, give triage and identify what a deeper pass should check.
- When the artifact is incomplete, review the plan and risk areas rather than pretending to evaluate final readiness.
- When the user wants comments to send to someone else, tune relationship and power dynamics before wording.

## Anti-patterns

- Returning a line edit when the user asked for strategic feedback.
- Writing reviewer-style criticism when the user asked for mentor-style coaching.
- Giving a readiness verdict without checking destination constraints.
- Trying to cover every specialist lens in a quick scan.

## Diagnostic questions

- What decision will the feedback support?
- Is the user revising, submitting, rehearsing, mentoring, or deciding whether to continue?
- Does the user need a diagnosis, a rewrite, a report, or a checklist?
- How much time or revision capacity does the user have?

## Output patterns / mini-templates

```text
Mode: <quick/focused/deep/reviewer/mentor/readiness/line edit>.
Scope: <what I reviewed>.
Not covered: <what this pass does not attempt>.
Output: <prioritized findings or edited artifact>.
Next pass: <optional deeper route>.
```

## Examples

- "Can you quickly sanity-check this grant abstract?" -> quick scan with grant-writing and scientific-writing lenses.
- "Review this as a journal reviewer" -> reviewer-style critique with publishing-and-peer-review plus scientific-writing or figures as needed.
- "Help me give feedback to my student on this slide deck" -> mentor-style feedback with scientific-communication and tone/relationship routing.

## When not to apply this

Do not spend time on mode selection when the user has clearly requested a single concrete output.
