# Hypothesis Generation

## Use This When

Use this playbook when the user is stuck, needs new hypotheses, has unexpected data, wants a more creative angle, or is confusing idea generation with hypothesis testing.

## The Job Of This Topic

Create better possible explanations without pretending they are already evidence. The playbook should help the user move between exploratory imagination and precise tests.

## Default workflow

1. Put the user in exploration mode: allow analogy, contradiction, conversation, metaphor, and unusual associations.
2. Generate several candidate hypotheses or reframings.
3. Translate the most promising ones into variables, mechanisms, observable traces, or predictions.
4. Return to testing mode: choose the first observation that distinguishes alternatives.
5. Mark all speculative outputs as provisional until checked.

## Decision rules

- Alternate night-science generation with day-science testing.
- Represent iterative research as a spiral: background knowledge suggests a question, data are explored, the next hypothesis is revised, and then a sharper test follows.
- Treat contradictions as discovery sites: write the conflict, list hidden assumptions, and turn the best explanation into a discriminating prediction.
- Diagnose the puzzle type: assembling known pieces, finding a logical insight, importing an outside connection, or dropping an implicit assumption.
- Use metaphor or anthropomorphic language to build intuition, then translate it into testable scientific terms.
- Use trusted one-on-one or sequential paired conversation for fragile ideas before exposing them to harsh selection.

## Variants And Edge Cases

- If the user has a rich dataset, run an exploratory visualization pass before final interpretation, but label patterns as exploratory.
- If the user has only a metaphor, require translation before recommending evidence.
- If progress stalls, reclassify the puzzle rather than assuming more effort on the same path will work.
- If brainstorming in a group, protect fragile ideas from immediate status-driven criticism.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating creativity as a substitute for validation.
- Forcing every exploratory observation into the original hypothesis.
- Leaving metaphors literal.
- Dismissing anomalies before checking for hidden assumptions.
- Using large, low-trust brainstorming meetings for early fragile ideas.

## Diagnostic Questions

- Is the user currently generating ideas or selecting among them?
- What observation conflicts with expectation?
- What hidden assumption could explain the conflict?
- What kind of puzzle is this: assembly, logic, outside connection, hidden assumption, or unknown puzzle type?
- What would the metaphor predict if translated into variables?
- Who is the right science buddy for a low-stakes first pass?

## Examples

- Convert "the cell is choosing a path" into candidate variables, decision points, and observable state transitions.
- For an anomaly, list three hidden assumptions before calling it noise.
- Use a paired conversation to build a weak idea into a testable form before ranking it.

## When Not To Apply This

Do not use hypothesis-generation methods to justify a conclusion after the fact. Once the user asks what is true, switch to evidence and testing.
